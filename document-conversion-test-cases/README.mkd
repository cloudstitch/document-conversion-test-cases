Image testing -- I've seen this work in person to be confident we'll hammer out any remaining problems ourselves

## gdoc-to-msword-headers-and-paragraphs.docx

Perfect!

## gdoc-to-msword-list-elements.docx

1. There is YAML front matter where there should just be paragraph text. This document has no YAML front matter.  

## gdoc-to-msword-span-elements.docx

1. There is YAML front matter where there should just be paragraph text. This document has no YAML front matter.

1. Table exporting appears completely broken here.

Perfect!
